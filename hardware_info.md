### My ESP32 that I send to sleep (and run on battery).

I use a **Wemos/LilyGo TTGO T8 v1.7.1** with built-in battery connector (and charger) and can be had here:

but is generally available. 

Watch out that you have the battery connector and lead (included in the above product). It also has an SD card slot (which I don't use right now). It also uploads code via the USB port without you having to press any weird boot/reset button combination!

The battery I use is from a drone and is flat and has a capacity of 2500mAh which lasts all night with 15 minute wakeups.
