If you need to save power on your ESP32, Deep Sleep is a necessity.  

We'll take a look at how to wake up an ESP32 from a Deep Sleep and what you can do to maintain values across reboots from Deep Sleep.  

I'll explain all the kerfuffle (technical term) about QIO, QOUT, DIO and DOUT that caused me so much pain since the Espressif Framework update beyond 3.3.0.  

And some announcements! (Well, four in total)
